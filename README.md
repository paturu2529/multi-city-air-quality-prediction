- Random Forest feature importance analysis.

## 🤖 Machine Learning Models

Three regression algorithms were implemented:

### 1. Linear Regression
Used as a basic regression model to estimate PM2.5 concentration.

### 2. Decision Tree Regressor
Used to identify nonlinear relationships between input features and PM2.5 concentration.

### 3. Random Forest Regressor
An ensemble learning algorithm that combines multiple decision trees to improve prediction performance.

A Dummy Regressor was also used as a baseline for comparison.

## 📈 Model Evaluation

The models were evaluated using the following metrics:

- **MAE:** Mean Absolute Error
- **RMSE:** Root Mean Squared Error
- **R² Score:** Coefficient of Determination

### Model Performance Comparison

| Model | MAE | RMSE | R² Score |
|---|---:|---:|---:|
| Linear Regression | 4.8484 | 7.3570 | 0.9327 |
| Decision Tree | 4.2826 | 7.1860 | 0.9358 |
| Random Forest | 4.3964 | 7.0565 | 0.9381 |

**Best Overall Model:** Random Forest Regressor

The Random Forest model achieved the lowest RMSE and highest R² score among the three models. The Decision Tree achieved the lowest MAE.
